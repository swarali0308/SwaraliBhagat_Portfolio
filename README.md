# [Project_1:Registration and Login system with Python, file handling](https://github.com/swarali0308/registration.py/blob/master/main.py)
STAGE -- 1 Registration When the user chooses to Register

---> email/username should have "@" and followed by "." eg:- sherlock@gmail.com nothing@yahoo.in

---> it should not be like this eg:- @gmail.com there should not be any "." immediate next to "@" my@.in it should not start with special characters and numbers

---> password (5 < password length > 16) Must have minimum one special character, one digit, one uppercase, one lowercase character

Stage 2 Once the username and password are validated, store those values in a file

Stage 3 Login When the user chooses to Login, check whether his/her credentials exist in the file or not based on the user input If doesn’t exist ask them to go for Registration or If they have chosen forget password you should be able to retrieve their original password based on their username provided in the user input If nothing matches in your file you should ask them to Register

# [Project_2:Iron Man Jarvis AI Desktop Voice Assistant](https://github.com/swarali0308/Desktop-Voice-Assistant.py/blob/master/main.py)
Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. What can this A.I. assistant do for you? It can send emails on your behalf. It can play music for you. It can do Wikipedia searches for you. It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser. It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.

# [Project_3:Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/swarali0308/machine-learning-LR-/blob/main/Boston%20Housing%20Dataset-LRGD.pdf)
The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases. It can be used to predict the median value of a home, which is done here. There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are: CRIM - per capita crime rate by town ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) RM - average number of rooms per dwelling AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town LSTAT - % lower status of the population MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's Aim: To implement a linear regression with regularization via gradient descent. to implement gradient descent with Lp norm, for 3 different values of p in (1,2] To contrast the difference between performance of linear regression Lp norm and L2 norm for these 3 different values. Tally that the gradient descent for L2 gives same result as matrix inversion based solution.

# Project_4:Data_mining_project_covid.19 case study
The unprecedented, explosive growth of the COVID-19 domain presents challenges to researchers to keep up with research knowledge within the domain. Data_consists_of the columns:iso_code,location,date,total_cases,new_cases,total_deaths,new_deaths Result:The current outbreak of the novel‐coronavirus (COVID‐19), epicentered in China, has spread to many other countries. The case detection rate is changing daily
